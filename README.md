This project is part of The Odin Project, designed to help learners practice and solidify HTML skills. In this project, a basic recipe website has been created from scratch.

The website consists of a main index page that contains links to several recipes. Please note that the primary focus of this project is on HTML, and the website's appearance may be quite plain without extensive styling.

Key project details include:

- **HTML Skill Building**: This project serves as an opportunity to apply and reinforce knowledge of HTML. The structure and content for a recipe website have been created, gaining hands-on experience in HTML markup.

- **Recipe Index Page**: The main page of the website features links to various recipes, allowing for the practice of creating hyperlinks and organizing content.

- **Future Styling**: While the project may not include extensive styling initially, it's important to understand that this is just the first step. In the future, the chance to revisit this project and enhance its appearance using CSS will be available.

This project is valuable for honing HTML skills and lays the foundation for future styling and web development projects.
