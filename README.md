This project is part of The Odin Project, designed to help you practice and solidify your HTML skills. In this project, you will create a basic recipe website from scratch.

The website you build will consist of a main index page that contains links to several recipes. Please note that the primary focus of this project is on HTML, and the website's appearance may be quite plain without extensive styling.

Key project details include:

- **HTML Skill Building**: This project serves as an opportunity to apply and reinforce your knowledge of HTML. You'll create the structure and content for a recipe website, gaining hands-on experience in HTML markup.

- **Recipe Index Page**: The main page of the website will feature links to various recipes, allowing you to practice creating hyperlinks and organizing content.

- **Future Styling**: While the project may not include extensive styling initially, it's important to understand that this is just the first step. In the future, you'll have the chance to revisit this project and enhance its appearance using CSS.

This project is valuable for honing your HTML skills and lays the foundation for future styling and web development projects. Enjoy the process of building your basic recipe website!
